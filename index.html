    <h3>Some random information.</h3>



    <p>Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
        To get their kicks, get out of it quick
        And make all kinds of money and chicks
        And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
        Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that
        Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
        Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
        Good God Almighty
        THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL"</p>
